# Keyword-Extraction
This is a Machine Learning project on Keyword Extraction with Python. In machine learning, Keyword extraction is a task of Natural Language Processing.
A wide range of free Python NLP libraries offer some relatively easy-to-deploy tools that can help to uncover key features of large datasets. The tools allow to create single and multi-term keyword lists (called n-grams) from a large, unstructured data set. 

Text Mining offers several points of entry into a dataset that otherwise might look hopelessly impenetrable:<br>

Keywords themselves can be useful, particularly in formulating a response to “What are people most frequently talking/asking about?”<br>

Keywords can help you focus in on smaller sets of individual records in order to learn more about them and begin to answer particular questions about user needs and goals.<br>

Keywords in combination with analysis of smaller sets of individual records can help you identify gaps in your understanding of users that can help focus subsequent research efforts.<br>
